<h2>Write the content to a README.md file</h2>
This project implements a Face Mask Detection system using PyTorch. It can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not from images, videos, or live webcam feeds. The model is trained on a custom dataset and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification.

Features
Detects "Mask" and "No Mask" in images, videos, and live webcam feeds.
Supports transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet.
Configurable training parameters for custom datasets.
Real-time detection capability using OpenCV.
Easy-to-use modular codebase for further customization.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install PyTorch: Follow the instructions on the PyTorch official website to install PyTorch for your specific environment.

Usage
Dataset Preparation
Prepare your dataset with two folders: Mask and No_Mask, containing respective images.
Apply transformations (resize, normalization) as defined in the transform function.
Training
To train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --epochs 25 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001 --data_path ./dataset
Inference
On Images
Run detection on a single image:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect.py --image_path ./images/sample.jpg --weights ./weights/best_model.pth
On Video
Run detection on a video file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect.py --video_path ./videos/sample.mp4 --weights ./weights/best_model.pth
Live Webcam Detection
Run detection using a webcam:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect.py --webcam --weights ./weights/best_model.pth
Results
Here are some example outputs of the model:

Input Type	Detection Result
Image	✅ Detects "Mask" and "No Mask" correctly
Video	✅ Detects in real-time
